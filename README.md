## Code

A basic (works local without the need to build things or even a server)
scrollytelling template.


### Getting Started (Basic)
------
Open `01-example/index.html` in your browser. start editing the files in `01-example/`
in any code editor to change things.

### Getting Started (Advanced)
------
This requires some experience in using a command line as well as having node/npm
installed, but it gives the advantage to auto-reload pages when files are changed
and enables linting to keep your code nice and tidy.

install packages in the project directory
```
npm i
```

start a server
```
npm run serve
```
