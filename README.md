### Getting Started (Advanced)

This requires some experiece in using a command line as well as having node/npm
installed, but it gives the advantage to auto-reload pages when files are changed
and enables linting to keep your code nice and tidy.

```
npm i
```

start a server
```
npm run serve
```
